<h3>Boeing&nbsp;727</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 727 is a mid-size narrow-body three-engine jet aircraft
built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It can carry 149 to 189
passengers and later models can fly up to 2,400 to 2,700 nautical
miles (4,400 to 5,000 km) nonstop. Intended for short and
medium-length flights, the 727 can use fairly short runways at smaller
airports.

<h3>Boeing 737</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 737 is a short- to medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engined airliner derived from Boeing's 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of nine passenger models with a capacity of 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrow-body airliner in production.

<h3>Boeing 747</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 747 is a wide-body commercial airliner and cargo transport
aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, <em>Jumbo
Jet</em>. Its iconic "hump" upper deck along the forward part of the
aircraft make it among the world's most recognizable aircraft, and it
was the first wide-body produced.

<h3>Boeing 757</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner
that was designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the
manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was
produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass
cockpit, turbofan engines, a conventional tail and, for reduced
aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design.

<h3>Boeing 767</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, long-range, wide-body
twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was
the manufacturer's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with
a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a
conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical
wing design.

<h3>Boeing 777</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 777 is a family of long-range wide-body twin-engine jet
airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial
Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating
capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of 5,235 to 9,380
nautical miles (9,695 to 17,372 km). Commonly referred to as the
"Triple Seven",[3][4] its distinguishing features include the
largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, six wheels on each
main landing gear, a circular fuselage cross-section, and a
blade-shaped tail cone.

<h3>Boeing 787</h3>
<p>
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body,
twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Its
variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical 3-class seating
configurations. It is Boeing's most fuel-efficient airliner and the
world's first major airliner to use composite materials as the primary
material in the construction of its airframe. The 787 was designed to
be 20% more fuel efficient than the 767 it is replacing. The 787
Dreamliner's distinguishing features include mostly electrical flight
systems, a four-panel windshield, noise-reducing chevrons on its
engine nacelles, and a smoother nose contour.

<h3>Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk</h3>
<p>
The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine,
medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky
Aircraft. Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the United States
Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition
in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the YUH-60A and selected
the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off
competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61.

<h3>Bell 407</h3>
<p>
The Bell 407 is a four-blade, single-engine, civil utility helicopter;
a derivative of the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger. The 407 uses the
four-blade, soft-in-plane design rotor with composite hub developed
for the United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior instead of the
two-blade, semi-rigid, teetering, rotor of the 206L-4.
