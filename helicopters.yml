    Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS)
    competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the
    YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program

    The Bell 407 is a four-blade, single-engine, civil utility
    helicopter; a derivative of the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger. The 407
    uses the four-blade, soft-in-plane design rotor with composite hub
    developed for the United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior
    instead of the two-blade, semi-rigid, teetering, rotor of the
    206L-4.

    The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engine, tandem rotor
    heavy-lift helicopter. Its primary roles are troop movement,
    artillery placement and battlefield resupply. It has a wide
    loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage and three external-cargo
    hooks. With a top speed of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h) the
    helicopter was faster than contemporary 1960s utility helicopters
    and attack helicopters. The CH-47 is among the heaviest lifting
    Western helicopters. Its name is from the Native American Chinook
    people.
