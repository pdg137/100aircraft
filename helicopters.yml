    The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine,
    medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky

    Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS)
    competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the
    YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program
    in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol
    YUH-61.

    The Bell 407 is a four-blade, single-engine, civil utility
    helicopter; a derivative of the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger. The 407
    uses the four-blade, soft-in-plane design rotor with composite hub
    developed for the United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior
    instead of the two-blade, semi-rigid, teetering, rotor of the
    206L-4.
