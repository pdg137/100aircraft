    The Hawker Hunter is a subsonic British jet aircraft developed in
    the 1950s. The single-seat Hunter entered service as a
    manoeuvrable fighter aircraft, and later operated in
    fighter-bomber and reconnaissance roles in numerous
    conflicts. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and
    secondary roles with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy
    until the early 1990s. The Hunter was also widely exported,
    serving with 21 other air forces; 50 years after its original
    introduction it was still in active service, operated by the
    Lebanese Air Force until 2014.  </p> </div>
