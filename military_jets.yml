    manoeuvrable fighter aircraft, and later operated in
    fighter-bomber and reconnaissance roles in numerous
    conflicts. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and
    secondary roles with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy
    until the early 1990s. The Hunter was also widely exported,
    serving with 21 other air forces; 50 years after its original

    The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was a long-range fighter aircraft,
    manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and operated by the
    Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945. The A6M was designated
    as the Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter (零式艦上戦闘機), or
    the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen. The A6M was usually referred to by its
    pilots as the "Reisen" (zero fighter), "0" being the last digit of
    the Imperial year 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the
    Imperial Navy. The official Allied reporting name was "Zeke",
    although the use of the name "Zero" was later commonly adopted by
    the Allies as well.
