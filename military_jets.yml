    The Grumman A-6 Intruder was an American, twin jet-engine,
    mid-wing all-weather attack aircraft built by Grumman
    Aerospace. In service with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps
    between 1963 and 1997, the Intruder was designed as an all-weather
    medium attack aircraft to replace the piston-engined Douglas A-1
    Skyraider. As the A-6E was slated for retirement, its precision
    strike mission was taken over by the Grumman F-14 Tomcat equipped
    with a LANTIRN pod.
