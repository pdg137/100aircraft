    The Space Shuttle orbiter was the reusable spaceplane component of
    the Space Shuttle program. Operated by NASA,[1] the U.S. space
    agency, this vehicle could carry astronauts and payloads into low
    Earth orbit, perform in-space operations, then re-enter the
    atmosphere and land as a glider, returning its crew and any
    on-board payload to the Earth.
