    The Boeing 737 is a short- to medium-range twinjet narrow-body
    airliner. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost
    twin-engined airliner derived from Boeing's 707 and 727, the 737
    has developed into a family of nine passenger models with a
    capacity of 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only
    narrow-body airliner in production.

    produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member
    glass cockpit, turbofan engines, a conventional tail and, for
    reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design.

    airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial
    Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical
    seating capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of 5,235
    to 9,380 nautical miles (9,695 to 17,372 km). Commonly referred to
    as the "Triple Seven",[3][4] its distinguishing features include
    the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, six wheels
    on each main landing gear, a circular fuselage cross-section, and
    a blade-shaped tail cone.

    The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body,
    twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial
    Airplanes. Its variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical
    3-class seating configurations. It is Boeing's most fuel-efficient
    airliner and the world's first major airliner to use composite
    materials as the primary material in the construction of its
    airframe. The 787 was designed to be 20% more fuel efficient than
    the 767 it is replacing. The 787 Dreamliner's distinguishing
    features include mostly electrical flight systems, a four-panel
    windshield, noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles, and a
    smoother nose contour.
