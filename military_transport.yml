    The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military
    transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed, now
    Lockheed Martin. Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs
    and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop,
    medical evacuation, and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile
    airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as
    a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue,
    scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial
    refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting. It is now the
    main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide. Over
    40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60
    nations.

    airlifter designed by the Ilyushin design bureau. It was first
    planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for
    the Antonov An-12. It was designed for delivering heavy machinery
    to remote, poorly served areas of the USSR. Military versions of
    the Il-76 have seen widespread use in Europe, Asia and Africa,
    including use as an airborne refueling tanker or as a command
    center.

    The Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker is a military aerial refueling
    aircraft. It and the Boeing 707 airliner were developed from the
    Boeing 367-80 prototype. The KC-135 was the US Air Force's first
    jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the KC-97
    Stratofreighter. The KC-135 was initially tasked to refuel
    strategic bombers, but was used extensively in the Vietnam War and
    later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm to extend the range
    and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.
