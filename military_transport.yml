    The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military
    transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed, now
    Lockheed Martin. Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs
    and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop,
    medical evacuation, and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile
    airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as
    a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue,
    scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial
    refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting. It is now the
    main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide. Over
    40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60
    nations.

    The Ilyushin Il-76 is a multi-purpose four-engine strategic
    airlifter designed by the Ilyushin design bureau. It was first
    planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for
    the Antonov An-12. It was designed for delivering heavy machinery
    to remote, poorly served areas of the USSR. Military versions of
    the Il-76 have seen widespread use in Europe, Asia and Africa,
    including use as an airborne refueling tanker or as a command
    center.
